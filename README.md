## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), served as a single-page application.
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js) for RESTful APIs and authentication; Python (Flask) for AI/ML and image analysis.
- **Database:** Demo data in JSON files; scalable for MongoDB/PostgreSQL in production.
- **AI/ML:** Integrates with OpenRouter (Llama models) and Google Gemini for chat and image analysis.

---

## Frontend

- All UI components are in the `static/` and `templates/` directories.
- Main modules: Dashboard, AI Doctor, Medicine Delivery, Doctor Consultation, Lab Tests, Hospitals, Pharmacy.
- Uses dynamic JavaScript modules for data loading, filtering, and user interaction.
- Responsive and accessible design with modern CSS.

---

## Backend

### Node.js (Express.js)
- Handles RESTful API endpoints for medicines, doctors, tests, hospitals, and pharmacies.
- Provides authentication (registration, login, JWT/session management).
- Serves static files and the main HTML template.

### Python (Flask)
- Handles AI chat and image analysis endpoints.
- `/ask`: Receives user messages and returns AI-generated responses.
- `/analyze-image`: Accepts prescription images, extracts structured information, and provides explanations.

### AI/ML Integration
- **OpenRouter API:** Primary provider for chat and image analysis (Llama models).
- **Google Gemini API:** Backup for image analysis if OpenRouter fails.
- System prompts ensure safe, helpful, and non-diagnostic responses.

---

## Data & Demo Content

- Demo data is stored in `static/data/` as JSON files:
  - `medicines.json`, `doctors.json`, `tests.json`, `hospitals.json`, `pharmacies.json`, etc.
- Each file contains realistic, structured data for demo and development purposes.

---
